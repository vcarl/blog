I recently cancelled my Coinbase debit card. I signed up when it was
announced, using it for a small number of recurring transaction in
because of the generous rewards, cashback in the form of cryptocurrency
of my choice. In August 2022, I started seeing transactions I didn't
recognize, and began searching for a way to dispute them.

I learned that Coinbase has no visible support articles on how to
dispute Card transactions, and no "happy path" for it through their
support channels. The transaction history has a large "Contact Support"
button, but the subsequence screen (at time of writing) does not have a
way to report the specific transaction. The only way forward with
support is to send an email, but there are no instructions on what
information to provide. The top result for
["coinbase card hacked" on Google](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/privacy-and-security/account-compromised/my-account-was-compromised)
refers to online Coinbase accounts, not their Card product specifically,
and the
[page explaining how to report an unauthorized transaction](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/privacy-and-security/account-compromised/how-do-i-report-an-unauthorized-transaction)
refers to bank transfers, not Card payments. It refers people to
[a decision tree](https://www.coinbase.com/charge) which is not aware of
Coinbase Card. I reported my card stolen, locking it and requesting a
new physical card.

Less than 6 hours after I requested a new card, I spotted a new batch of
transactions I didn't recognize. My takeaway: Coinbase Card is unsafe.
Newly shipped cards are cracked before arriving in the mail. Coinbase
and its vendors have failed to secure Coinbase Cards, and have failed to
adequately respond to a problem that has existed for over a year. I
believe that an upstream vendor for the debit cards has been hacked,
beginning in or around October 2021. Numerous reports began surfacing on
reddit:

Coinbase issues the cards through Pathward, formerly known as MetaBank.
Pathward has
[991 complaints on the Better Business Bureau website](https://www.bbb.org/us/sd/sioux-falls/profile/bank/pathward-venture-capital-llc-0714-300019615/complaints)
over the past 3 years and 100% response rate by the business — I
consider BBB a low-value signal, but the company is clearly monitoring
reports and attempting to reactively manage its reputation.

Because it's a debit card, the liability will be on users to prove
fraud.

Coinbase owes its users a better response and a higher degree of
confidence. It has not communicated clearly to its users about the risks
they're subjected to, and it has not focused on putting customer safety
first. Coinbase has never proactively communicated the increase in
fraud, and has made no public statements acknowledging the problem or
explaining how they will protect their users. Instead, they've seemingly
ignored the problem for over a year, without even offering appropriate
support channels.
